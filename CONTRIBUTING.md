This addon does not fully install ember-cli as it only relies on Node.js and
Broccoli.js aspects of ember-cli, which are not dependant on having ember-cli
fully installed.

### Questions / Issues / Feature Requests

All questions, issues, bugs, feature requests can be submitted as an Issue on
this repo. Our only request is that you provide enough details to be meaningful
and be respectful (see the Code of Conduct).

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests are always welcome. If you have a feature request and have an
idea on how to implement it, feel free to submit a PR. Otherwise an Issue with
the request is alright too, it'll get the discussion rolling. There are no
specific PR structure requirements at this point, however, we might change the
commit message for clarification as needed.
